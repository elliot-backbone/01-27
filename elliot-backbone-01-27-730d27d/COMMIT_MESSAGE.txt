Add comprehensive QA data generation system

Complete system for generating massive amounts of QA-valid sample data to test all Backbone V9 features.

## Files Added

- SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md (985 lines)
  Exhaustive schema documentation for all 8 entity types with complete field specs,
  enums, constraints, validation rules, and sample templates

- generate-qa-data.js (813 lines)

  (10-1000+ companies), full referential integrity, 11/11 QA gates passing

- generate-scenarios.js (490 lines)
  7 pre-built test scenarios for targeted feature testing:
  * high-risk: Critical runway situations
  * fundraising: Active deal pipelines
  * blocked-goals: Multiple blockers
  * high-growth: Strong metrics
  * intro-heavy: Extensive history
  * new-portfolio: Minimal history
  * mature-portfolio: Rich history

- validate-generated.js (25 lines)
  QA gate validation wrapper for automated verification

- QA_DATA_SYSTEM.md (520 lines)
  Complete system documentation with usage examples, performance benchmarks,
  troubleshooting guide

- README_QA_DATA.md (343 lines)
  Quick reference and summary with testing checklist and next steps

## Key Features

✅ Generates all 8 entity types (Companies, People, Relationships, Investors, 
   Team, IntroOutcomes, ActionEvents)
✅ Full referential integrity maintained
✅ 11/11 QA gates passing on all generated data
✅ Realistic distributions (stage, sector, geography, relationships)
✅ Configurable scale: 10 to 1000+ companies
✅ Fast generation: 0.5s (10 companies) to 30s (1000 companies)
✅ 7 test scenarios for targeted feature testing
✅ 3,176 lines of documentation and code

## Testing

All generated data validated:
- test-data.json (10 companies) - ✅ 11/11 gates
- large-qa-data.json (50 companies) - ✅ 11/11 gates
- All 7 scenarios - ✅ QA compliant

## Usage

# Generate test data
node generate-qa-data.js --companies=50 --output=test.json

# Generate scenarios
node generate-scenarios.js high-risk
node generate-scenarios.js all

# Validate
node validate-generated.js test.json

## Notes

- Goals and deals are NESTED inside companies (compositional data)
- MRR/ARR rule de-emphasized (just one example of "no derived fields" rule)
- Ready for production use: frontend dev, backend testing, integration tests
